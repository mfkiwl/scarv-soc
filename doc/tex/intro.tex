The \SCARVSOC is a technology demonstrator platform for outputs of the 
SCARV project.
It comprises an augmented RISC-V CPU core, on-chip memory and a
collection of common peripherals, aiming to replicate the functionality
found on a IoT class SoC.
The entire system is optimised for secure and efficient execution of
cryptographic workloads.
Power and EM side-channel attacks are specifically considered,
with support for several hardware and software countermeasures.

The rest of this report is organised as follows:
\SECREF{features} details the feature requirements for
the \SCARVSOC.
\SECREF{organisation} explains how the project is organised in terms
of it's directory structure and flows.
\SECREF{design} describes the overal system design and the major
sub-system components.
\SECREF{hw-flows} details the hardware design and verification flows.
\SECREF{sw-development} describes how to develop software to run on
the \SCARVSOC.
