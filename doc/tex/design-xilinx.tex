The outer subsystem layer contains several 3rd party IP cores:

\begin{itemize}

\item AXI4 GPIO \cite{SCARV:XILINX:GPIO}.
    A 2 bank GPIO peripheral.

\item AXI4 UARTLite \cite{SCARV:XILINX:UART-Lite}.
    A 128000 baud UART peripheral.

\item AXI4 Bus Interconnect \cite{SCARV:XILINX:AXI-IC}.
    Responsible for implementing the 2nd level of the memory map.
    Connects the UART and GPIO peripherals to the AXI4-Lite bridge.

\item System Clock Generator \cite{SCARV:XILINX:ClockingWizard}.
    Responsible for scaling the 200MHz external clock down to
    100MHz.
    This is a board specific requirement, since we are using the
    SASEBO G-III development platform.

\item Processor System Reset \cite{SCARV:XILINX:ProcessorReset}.
    Brings up the peripherals, interconnect and CPU in a safe
    manner after reset.

\end{itemize}
