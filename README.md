# [SCARV](https://github.com/scarv): SoC

---

*Acting as a component part of the
[SCARV](https://www.scarv.org)
project,
SCARV-SoC is a technology demonstrator for several outputs of the SCARV Project.
The SoC consists of a set of common peripherals,
controlled by a custom
[RISC-V CPU](https://github.com:/scarv/scarv-cpu),
augmented with the
[XCrypto](https://github.com/scarv/xcrypto)
instruction set extensions.
Together,
this forms an integrated side-channel aware SoC,
capable of efficient and secure cryptographic code execution.*
