The AXI bus bridge translates requests from the CPU data memory
bus into an AXI4-Lite interface.
The AXI4-Lite interface should then be used to interface with 3rd party
IP and peripherals.
The bridge does not allow multiple outstanding requests.
One request must fully complete before a new one can begin.
