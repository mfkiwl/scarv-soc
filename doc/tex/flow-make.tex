The entire build and simulation flow for the \SCARVSOC project is
automated using GNU Make.
The root makefile is found at {\tt \$SOC\_HOME/Makefile}.
All make commands sould be run from the project root directory.
The root makefile then {\em includes} all other nessesary Makefiles
from across the project.
Each sub-makefile (named {\tt <subdir>/Makefile.in}) is responsible for
a single piece of the design flow.
This means that certain makefiles can depend on others in ways which
are not always immediately apparent.

Most sub-makefiles are found in one of the {\tt \$SOC\_HOME/flow/*}
directories.
The only exceptions to this are the software build makefiles for
the example programs, board support package and first stage bootloader.
