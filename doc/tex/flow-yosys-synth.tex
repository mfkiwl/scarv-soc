The Yosys synthesis flow is a way of checking the relative
sizes of different SoC components when targeting an abstract CMOS
device.

\begin{itemize}

\item The synthesis scripts and make flow are found in
    {\tt \$SOC\_HOME/flow/synthesis}.

\item Run the synthesis flow:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,style=block]
> make synthesise
\end{lstlisting}

\item Reports and output artifacts from the synthesis run are placed
    in {\tt \$SOC\_WORK/synthesis/}.

\end{itemize}
