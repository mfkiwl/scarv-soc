The verilator flow is responsible for creating executable simulation
models of the \SCARVSOC inner subsystem.
It wraps the verilated model in a testbench, which emulates the
3rd party peripherals using C++ models.

\begin{itemize}
\item Makefiles and manifests are found in {\tt \$SOC\_HOME/flow/verilator}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Looking inside the manifest files will show exactly which testbench
    and RTL files are included in the simulation models.
\end{itemize}
\item Testbench source code is found in {\tt \$SOC\_HOME/verif/scarv-soc}.
\end{itemize}
